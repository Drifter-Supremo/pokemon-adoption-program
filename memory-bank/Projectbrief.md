# **Project Brief – Pokémon Adoption Program** 🛡️

## **🎯 Goal**
Create a **Tamagotchi-style virtual pet game** featuring **Mimikyu**, where players care for their Pokémon, interact through simple mechanics, and maintain its happiness over time.

## **📌 Core Mechanics**
- **Four Needs to Manage**: Hunger, Happiness, Cleanliness, Energy.
- **Decay System**: Needs decrease over time, requiring interaction.
- **User Actions**: Feed, Play, Clean, Sleep.
- **Mimikyu’s Mood**: Different states based on care level.
- **Happiness System**: Builds trust or causes sadness based on care.
- **Memory System**: Tracks long-term happiness and player care habits.

## **🌟 Key Features**
✅ **Sprites & Animations** – Mimikyu reacts in real-time.  
✅ **Sounds & Feedback** – Actions trigger appropriate sound effects.  
✅ **Simple Save System** – Game remembers Mimikyu’s condition over time.  
✅ **User-Friendly UI** – Easy-to-use interface for interactions.  
✅ **Emotional Engagement** – Players feel attached to their Mimikyu.  

## **⚙️ Technical Overview**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Animation**: Canvas API or CSS animations.
- **State Tracking**: JavaScript Object / LocalStorage.
- **Development Assistant**: Cline AI in VS Code.

## **🎮 Gameplay Loop**
1. **Start the game** → Mimikyu appears in its idle animation.
2. **Needs decrease over time** → Indicators show which need attention.
3. **User takes action** → Press buttons to feed, play, clean, or sleep.
4. **Mimikyu reacts** → Changes expression, plays animations, and makes sounds.
5. **Game saves progress** → Happiness is stored and remembered next session.
6. **Long-term effects** → Mimikyu either **becomes more attached** or **slowly fades away** if neglected.

## **📅 Development Plan**
### **🟢 Phase 1: Setup**
- Display Mimikyu sprite
- Basic animations (idle state)
- Setup UI layout

### **🟢 Phase 2: Core Interactions**
- Implement needs system
- Add buttons for feed/play/clean/sleep
- Animate reactions

### **🟢 Phase 3: Sound & Feedback**
- Implement sound effects
- Add visual feedback for interactions

### **🟢 Phase 4: Memory & Emotion System**
- Track happiness over multiple sessions
- Implement Mimikyu's “bonding” mechanic

### **💡 Notes for Cline**
1. **Use separate scripts** for game logic, animations, and interactions.
2. **Prioritize a simple MVP** before adding complex mechanics.
3. **Focus on step-by-step implementation** to avoid overwhelming errors.
