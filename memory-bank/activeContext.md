    - `debugToggleNightMode()`: Toggles between night and day modes persistently
  - Fixed sad animation frame mapping to properly display all frames of the animation
  - Improved debug panel layout:
    - Relocated to right side of the screen
    - Stacked buttons vertically for better organization
    - Added clear labels indicating temporary vs. persistent effects
  - Kept existing hungry animation test while adding the new functionality

    - Action buttons (Feed, Play, Clean, Sleep): top: 750px, left: 9px
    - Sound toggle: top: 13px, left: 1065px (moved to top right corner)
    - Pok√©dex button: top: 335px, left: 1084px (repositioned for better placement)

  - Increased size of sound toggle and Pok√©dex buttons for better usability:
    - Sound toggle enlarged from 50px √ó 50px to 80px √ó 80px (60% larger) with font size increased from 24px to 36px
    - Pok√©dex button dramatically enhanced with scale(3.5) and padding for better visibility and usability (no background effects)
  - Implemented absolute pixel positioning for Game Boy border and game screen
  - Changed transform-origin to 'top left' for more predictable scaling
