## **üîç Current Focus**

The Pok√©mon Adoption Program is now in the **implementation phase**. We have:

- Completed the project planning and documentation
- Gathered all required art assets
- Defined the core game mechanics and architecture
- Set up the project structure
- Implemented fully functional game with grid-based sprite sheet animations
- Created responsive mobile-friendly UI with emoji-based indicators
- Refined animation system for smoother playback and accurate timing
- Implemented custom animation handling for special actions (hop, clean)
- Added Pok√©dex feature with detailed information about Mimikyu

The current focus is on **enhancing the user experience with additional features** and **improving game mechanics**.

## **üîÑ Recent Changes**

- **Pok√©dex Feature Implementation**: 
  - Added comprehensive Pok√©dex data display system
  - Created mobile-friendly modal UI with detailed information
  - Implemented grid-based stat bars with color coding
  - Added button with custom icon for accessing Pok√©dex
- **Background Improvements**: Updated to new day and night background images for better visual appeal
- **Sound Balance Adjustment**: Reduced background music volume from 0.5 to 0.2 for better audio balance
- **Initial Documentation**: Created memory bank files with detailed project structure
- **Asset Organization**: All sprite, background, and sound assets are in place
- **Planning**: Defined technical approach, state management, and architectural patterns
- **Core Implementation**: Created complete application with game state system and interactive controls
- **Grid-Based Animation System**: Developed sophisticated sprite animation system that handles multiple grid layouts:
  - mimikyu_idle: 4√ó8 grid (32 frames)
  - mimikyu_hungry: 10√ó8 grid (80 frames)
  - mimikyu_sad: 2√ó8 grid (16 frames)
  - mimikyu_sleep: 2√ó1 grid (2 frames)
  - mimikyu_hop: 10√ó8 grid (80 frames)
  - mimikyu_cleanliness: 9√ó8 grid (72 frames)
- **UI Improvements**: Replaced image-based icons with emoji indicators for better reliability
- **Animation Refinements**: 
  - Improved animation timing with XML-based frame durations
  - Implemented special handling for hop and clean animations with fixed durations (8s and 7s)
  - Added state-aware animation system that prioritizes hunger state animations
  - Added simple debug interface for testing hungry animation state
- **State Logic Update**: Modified state transitions to follow the product requirements:
  - Only hunger triggers automatic animation changes (plus sleep)
  - Other states rely on UI indicators until button press
- **Sound System Enhancements**:
  - Implemented periodic hungry sound alerts (every 5 seconds) instead of continuous loop
  - Fixed background music pause/resume functionality during important sounds
  - Improved sleep sound handling to prevent infinite loops
  - Added proper cleanup for all sound effects
  - Enhanced coordination between animation sounds and mood sounds

## **ü§î Active Decisions**

### **Current Considerations**
- **Animation Frame Rate**: Balancing smoothness vs. performance on mobile devices
- **Animation Transitions**: Improving transitions between different animation states
- **Engagement Mechanics**: Exploring ways to increase long-term engagement
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving game responsiveness on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Adding features to make the game more accessible to all users

### **Implementation Decisions**
- **Grid-Based Canvas Animation**: Implemented sophisticated animation system for varied sprite sheet layouts
- **Frame-by-Frame Control**: Added ability to precisely control animation frames for development
- **CSS-Based Indicators**: Using emoji and CSS for need indicators instead of image files
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized layout and interactions for mobile devices
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented efficient state management with the observer pattern
- **Debug Mode**: Created comprehensive debug tools to aid development and testing
