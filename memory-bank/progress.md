## **🚨 Known Issues**

- Need to verify the interface on various mobile device sizes

## **🔧 Recently Resolved Issues**

- ✅ Added testing functionality for previously hard-to-test features:
  - Implemented `debugForceSad()` for testing the sad animation with proper sound effects
    - Extended test duration from 10 to 30 seconds for better observation
  - Enhanced night mode testing options:
    - Implemented `debugForceNight()` for temporary night background testing
    - Added `debugToggleNightMode()` for persistent night/day toggling
  - Improved debug panel UI:
    - Relocated to right side of screen for less intrusion
    - Stacked buttons vertically for better organization
    - Clarified button labels to indicate temporary vs. persistent effects
- ✅ Fixed animation system issues:
  - Added special frame mapping for sad animation to properly display all 16 frames in the sprite sheet
  - Ensured consistent animation behavior with other special animations (hop, clean)

- ✅ Fixed button positioning and visibility issues:
  - Placed action buttons at optimal coordinates (top: 750px, left: 9px)
  - Positioned sound toggle in top right corner (top: 13px, left: 1065px)
  - Moved Pokédex button to right side panel (top: 335px, left: 1084px)
  - Enhanced button visibility and usability:
    - Sound toggle enlarged to 80px × 80px with increased font size
    - Pokédex button dramatically improved with scale(3.5), padding, and defined image dimensions (no background)
  - Resolved button visibility by removing overflow restrictions
  - Used high z-index values (999) to ensure buttons appear above other elements
- ✅ Successfully deployed application to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Implemented Game Boy-style border with custom assets
- ✅ Fixed aspect ratio issues with 4:3 game screen inside Game Boy border
- ✅ Replaced button styles with custom Game Boy-style button images
- ✅ Fixed Pokédex scrolling issues on mobile touch devices
- ✅ Improved responsive design with landscape and portrait orientation support
